# CSGO Zombie Escape Server List display in Console
 A server browser built into csgo console with shortcuts for connecting to servers. Highly customizeable and faster than using the community server browser.
 
 The only downside to this is that it only lists server, but does not get information such as player amounts, map, etc. The use for this is limited, but can still allow for quick ways of hopping servers.
 # Feel free to copy and modify!
 The goal of this project was to create a customizeable structure/framework that people can also modify to fit their own needs.
 # Installation Guide
